# Build projects

## What is this
Whenever a build something physical I'll share any related digital assets, like plans, 3d models etc.

## Workbench
A workbench design I design and built. I had some leftover countertop from our laundry so decided to turn it into a workbench for crafting projects.
The only modification I have made to the design (which is not included in the SketchUp file) is to put casters on the bottom of it so I can easily move it around the shed.
