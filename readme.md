# Build projects

## Workbench
A workbench design I created and built. I had some leftover countertop from our laundry so decided to turn it into a workbench for crafting projects.
The only modification I have made to the design (which is not included in the SketchUp file) is to put casters on the bottom of it so I can easily move it around the shed.
